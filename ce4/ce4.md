## Total 10 Marks

## Task 1 (3 Marks)

Consider the following use requirements of a online tuition system. 

A customer signs up an account in the online tuition system. During the sign-up, the customer needs
to supply the following particulars 

1. the customer's email, preferred password and mobile number.
1. the customer's child/ward's such as age and current education level.
1. the tuition subject. 

Upon successful sign-up, the system sends a confirmation email to the customer.

After login, the customer browses through the list of tutor profiles. The customer selects a tutor
she prefers to view the tutor's available time slots. Upon selecting a slot, the customer needs to pay 
for the session that she books using a credit card. The system verifies the credit card payment. 
Upon successful payment, the system sends an email confirmation to the customer for her booking. 
The system sends an email and SMS notification to the tutor regarding the booking. 
When the payment is unsuccessful, the system prompts the customer to use a different payment method. 
The customer can logout from the system anytime she wants.   

Analyse and document the above system requirement in at least two use case documents. 

## Task 2 (4 Marks)


Continue from the system requirements from Task 1. 

An hour before the booked online tuition session, the system sends an SMS reminder to the customer and the tutor about the upcoming session. The tutor starts the teaching session based on the booked time slot. The customer's child/ward joins the session using customer's account. When the session ends, the tutor assigns homework to the child/ward. The child/award attempts the homework and submits the answer to the tutor through the system. The tutor grades the child/ward's homework and gives a grade and a comment. 

Analyse and document the above system requirement in use case documents. (You decide how many are there.) 

## Task 3 (3 Marks)
Summarize the use cases from Task 1 and Task 2 in a use case diagram.
