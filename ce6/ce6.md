# Cohort Exercise - Sequence Diagram, Solution Class Diagram and Layered Architecture


## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this exercise, you should be able to

1. Analyse system behaviour using sequence diagrams

1. Define system components to match layered software architecture

## Total 20 Marks

## Task 1 (10 Marks)

Refer to the Online Tutoring System you have analysed in CE4 and CE5.

1. Choose a use case you defined in CE4 which satisfy the below conditions.

    1. At least six steps in operational flow.
    1. At least one alternative flow.
    1. At least one error state

1. Derive a sequence diagram assuming MVC architecture.

## Task 2 (5 Marks)

Derive the Solution class diagram by extending the domain class diagram derived in CE5 (Sufficient to include classes related to the use case you chose).

## Task 3 (5 Marks)

Derive the layered architecture diagram for the above use case considering Model, View, Controller, Service, Repository, and Database layers. Show the class names and the dependancy directions.
